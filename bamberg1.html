This coin features Henry II (Saint Henry) born 973, died 1024. Holy Roman Emperor from 1014 - 1024. Last Ruler of the Ottonian Dynasty. <br><br>
         Henry II strengthened the relationship between the Empire and the Catholic Church. He granted land and the title of "Prince of The Empire" to bishops, instead of nobility. Cleric princes made up a large part of Henry II's Imperial army, and counties were assigned to secular rulership by bishops. 
         Due to his promotion of the church, he was the only medieval German monarch to be honored as a Saint. <br><br>
