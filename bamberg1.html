This coin features Henry II (Saint Henry) born 973, died 1024. Holy Roman Emperor from 1014 - 1024. Last Ruler of the Ottonian Dynasty. <br>
         Henry II strengthened the relationship between the Empire and the Catholic Church. He granted land and the title of "Prince of The Empire" to bishops, instead of nobility. Cleric princes made up a large part of Henry II's Imperial army, and counties were assigned to secular rulership by bishops. 
         Due to his promotion of the church, he was the only medieval German monarch to be honored as a Saint. <br><br>
         Henry II is holding The Globus Cruciger, a cross on top of an orb, representing Christ's dominion over the world. It is part of the Imperial Regalia, along with the crown and the Imperial sceptre. The coin's value (4) is in the orb.

Bamberg is a German town dating back to the 9th century. It was the center of the Holy Roman Empire during the 12th century.<br><br>
         Lothar Franz von Schönborn was the Bishop of Bamberg from 1693 to 1729, and was also the Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1711 he crowned Charles VI of Austria as the Holy Roman Emperor.<br>
         Charles VI awarded Lothar 100,000 guldens for his loyalty. Lothar used these funds to begin construction on Schloss Weißenstein, a palatial residence in Bamberg. The palace holds the largest private art gallery in Germany, and is still owned by the Schönborn family today.
