According to legend, miners in the Harz Mountains of Germany encountered a "Wild Man" in 1529. The wild man was described as being coverd in hair, wearing only leaves and a moss cap. He wielded an uprooted fir tree as a weapon.
<br>
<br>
The wild man was hunted and captured, he later died from his wounds before he could be brought to the Duke of Brunswick. Large silver deposits were discovered where the wild man was captured, in West Harz. The town of "Wildemann" was founded at this location in 1529. 
Depictions of the "Wild Man" can be found on coins from the 1500s - 1800s.
