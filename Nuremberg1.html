The Thirty Years' War was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history, lasting from 1618 to 1648. Fought primarily in Central Europe, an estimated 4.5 to 8 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of battle, famine, or disease, while parts 
     of present-day Germany reported population declines of over 50%. The first phase from 1618 until 1635 was primarily a civil war between German members of the Holy Roman Empire, with support from external powers. After 1635, the empire became one theatre in a wider struggle 
     between France, supported by Sweden, and Emperor Ferdinand III, allied with Spain. 
<br>
<br>
The Peace of Westphalia is the collective name for two peace treaties signed in October 1648. A diplomatic congress was convened in Nuremberg in the Spring of 1649 to address the mechanics of implementing the Peace of Westphalia. Nuremberg had largely escaped the destruction 
     so widespread in the Empire and served as a relatively intact venue for the congress. Negotiations began in April 1649 and centered largely between the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Sweden.  France, Spain, and the individual states of the empire had only secondary roles. 
     The final treaty was signed on June 16, 1650.

A number of coins were issued in Nuremberg to commemorate the peace: 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 Klippe Thalers. A klippe is a word of Swedish origin (meaning "to shear") referring to a coin struck by a hammer on an irregularly shaped flan. These were initially made for emergency 
     currency by cities under siege in the 1500s, they were later used for commemorative coins. 
<br>
<br>
A group of boys rode their stick horses to the delegate appointed by Emperor Ferdinand III, asking him for a way to commemorate the peace. These 1/8 thalers were minted as a result.
