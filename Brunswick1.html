According to legend, miners in the Harz Mountains of Germany encountered a "Wild Man" in 1529. The wild man was described as being coverd in hair, wearing only leaves and a moss cap. He wielded an uprooted fir tree as a weapon.
<br>
<br>
The wild man was hunted and captured, he later died from his wounds before he could be brought to the Duke of Brunswick. Large silver deposits were discovered where the wild man was captured, in West Harz. The town of "Wildemann" was founded at this location in 1529. 
Depictions of the "Wild Man" can be found on coins from the 1500s - 1800s.

              Rudolph Augustus was Duke of Brunswick-L端neburg from 1666 until his death. Rudolph was more interested in studying and hunting. He left most goverment decisions to his younger brother, Anthony Ulrich. In 1685 Rudoplh made Anthony his co-ruler with equal rights. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Anthony Ulrich made significant additions to the the Bibliotheca Augusta, the largest library north of the Alps in the 17th Century. The library was well protected, and one of the oldest in the world to have never suffered loss to its collection.
