<br>
The Thirty Years' War was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history, lasting from 1618 to 1648. Fought primarily in Central Europe, an estimated 4.5 to 8 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of battle, famine, or disease, while parts
<br>
of present-day Germany reported population declines of over 50%. The first phase from 1618 until 1635 was primarily a civil war between German members of the Holy Roman Empire, with support from external powers. After 1635, the empire became one theatre in a wider struggle 
<br>
between France, supported by Sweden, and Emperor Ferdinand III, allied with Spain. The Peace of Westphalia is the collective name for two peace treaties signed in October 1648. A diplomatic congress was convened in Nuremberg in the Spring of 1649 to address the mechanics
<br>
of implementing the Peace of Westphalia. Nuremberg had largely escaped the destruction so widespread in the Empire and served as a relatively intact venue for the congress. Negotiations began in April 1649 and centered largely between the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Sweden. 
<br>
France, Spain, and the individual states of the empire had only secondary roles. The final treaty was signed on June 16, 1650. A number of coins were issued in Nuremberg to commemorate the peace: 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 Klippe Thalers. A klippe is a word of Swedish origin (meaning "to shear") 
<br>
referring to a coin struck by a hammer on an irregularly shaped flan. These were initially made for emergency currency by cities under siege in the 1500s, they were later used for commemorative coins. 
<br>
It is said that a group of boys from the city rode their stick horses to request a souvenir to commemorate the peace. These 1/8 thalers were minted as a result.
